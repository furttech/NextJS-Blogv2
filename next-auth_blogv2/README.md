This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project is an extension from the original getting started with nextjs tutorial. After reaching a point in development that required a complete rewrite to allow multi user profiles and user follow/blocking the decision was made to move all code from NEXTJS/APPROUTER/NEXT_AUTH-BLOG into a proper repo structure called NEXT_AUTH-BLOGV2. All future changes will occur within this repo to isolate development and allow for collaboration, branching and merging of the repo proper.

Note: This repo is now decoupled from the NEXTJS repo to allow git to function properly without pulling the entire NEXTJS repo. Issues with the old folder/repo layout caused git to pull/fetch the entire NEXTJS repo, commit, changes etc. This was a mistake on my part setting up the projects initially..

-- INFO --

Project Creator: Furt_Tech

Name(Temporary): Social App Blog v2 

-- Stack --

Nodejs / Nextjs 14 / NextAuth (AuthJs) v5 / Prisma (ORM) / Postgres SQL (DB)

-- Details --

The Goal of this project is to build a fully functional social media application within nextjs 14 in order to build an understanding and provide the community with an open source learning resource!

This is (at this point) not intended to be deployed as full scale public prod because it does not have cache, scaling or load balancing. However, future releases may result in additional features to address these issues by implementing the required functionality as time allots.

Thank you for checking out muh code... It sucks.. bare with me.
